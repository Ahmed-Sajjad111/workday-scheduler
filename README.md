# Work Day Scheduler 

## Purpose
A schedule for the average workshift timings that allows the user to list things that may need to be done by a certain time. It can then be saved and persist even if the browser has been closed. The hour blocks will constantly update to either show gray: past, red:current hour/due soon, green:future. The top of the page will always display the current month and day.
